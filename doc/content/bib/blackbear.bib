A procedure is given to determine the stress-modified fracture strain as a function of the stress triaxiality from smooth and notched bar tensile tests with FE analyses. For validation, simulated results using the proposed method are compared with experimental data for cracked bar (tensile and bend) tests, extracted from API X65 pipes, and for full-scale burst test of gouged pipes, showing overall good agreements. Advantages in the use of the proposed method for practical structural integrity assessment are discussed.}
