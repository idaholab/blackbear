!template! item key=introduction
Many of the phenomena related to structural component degradation depend on the
solutions of multiple physics models, which can be described by partial
differential equations that provide spatially and temporally varying values of
solution variables. These models for individual physics often depend on each
other. {{app}} relies on the MOOSE framework to solve these physics models,
accounting for the couplings that may occur between them. This document
describes the system design of {{app}}.

with no additional dependencies.

!template! item key=system-design
{{app}} relies on MOOSE to solve the coupled physics models underlying
structural component degradation, accounting for the couplings that may occur
between them. The design of MOOSE is based on the concept of modular code
objects that define all of the aspects of the physics model. {{app}} follows
this design, providing code objects that define specific aspects of the
solutions for its physics that derive from the base classes defined by the
MOOSE framework and the modules that it depends on.

{{app}} provides specialized `Kernel` classes that compute the contributions
from the terms in the partial differential equations for thermal and moisture
transport in concrete. It also provides specialized `Material` classes that
define the constitutive behavior of materials of interest for structural
components. In addition, it provides miscellaneous `BC`, `Action`, and
`Postprocessor` classes to facilitate various aspects of these simulations.
Much of the functionality of {{app}} is provided by the MOOSE modules that it
builds on.

!template! item key=system-structure
{{app}} relies on the MOOSE framework to provide the core functionality of
solving multiphysics problems using the finite element method. It also relies
on the MOOSE modules such as [Solid Mechanics](solid_mechanics/index.md) and
[Heat Transfer](heat_transfer/index.md) for much of its core functionality.
The structure of {{app}} is based on defining C++ classes that derive from
classes in the MOOSE framework or modules that provide functionality that is
specifically tailored to the structural degradation problem. By using the
interfaces defined in MOOSE base classes for these classes, {{app}} is able to
rely on MOOSE to execute these models at the appropriate times during the
simulation and use their results in the desired ways.
