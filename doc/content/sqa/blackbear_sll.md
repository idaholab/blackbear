## NEML

BlackBear relies on NEML, which is summarized as follows on the project website:
[github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/neml](https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/neml).

> NEML (the Nuclear Engineering Material model Library) is a tool for creating and running structural
> material models. While it was originally developed to model high temperature nuclear reactors, the
> tool is general enough to apply to most types of structural materials.

Current Version of NEML: [!git!submodule-hash url=https://github.com/Argonne-National-Laboratory/neml/commit](contrib/neml)
