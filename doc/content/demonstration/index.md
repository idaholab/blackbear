# Demonstration Problems

Demonstration problems in BlackBear include various benchmarking, validation, and assessment cases. An extensive problem database is being built to demonstrate various capabilities of BlackBear to address the degradation of structural materials. Some of the validation cases currently available in BlackBear are listed below:

| Structural Materials | Degradation Mechanisms | Validation Cases  |
| - | - | - |
| Plain Concrete | [ASR Expansion](ConcreteASREigenstrain.md) | [ASR Benchmark](ASR_validation/index.md)  |
| Plain Concrete | [ASR Expansion](ConcreteASREigenstrain.md) | [ASR Assessment](ASR_validation/index.md)  |
| Uniaxially Reinforced Concrete | [ASR Expansion](ConcreteASREigenstrain.md) | [ASR Assessment](ASR_validation/index.md)  |

More demonstration problems will be added to the BlackBear repository in the future.
